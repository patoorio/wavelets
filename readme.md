This is a fork of the gist https://gist.github.com/endolith/2783866

This fork adds:

* Option for specifying a specific set of desired scales
* Several minor fixes that add compatibility with Python3
* New getnormpower() function, that normalizes the power by the square root of the scales

Look at **WavelAnalysis.py** for an example of how to import and use the wavelets module
